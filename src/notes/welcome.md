# Getting Started with My Notes

Welcome to my personal notes collection! This is where I document my learning journey.

## How this works
These notes are just Markdown files stored in my GitHub repository. Whenever I push a new `.md` file to the `src/notes` folder, it automatically appears here.

## Why Markdown?
Markdown is:
- **Simple**: Easy to write and read.
- **Portable**: Can be viewed anywhere.
- **Developer-friendly**: Great for code snippets.

\`\`\`javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
